## synopsis
The book is about some kids who get in a plane crash and land on some abandoned island, then it defaults to a small scale democracy until one guy decides he wants to be in charge, leading to a conflict between the two, it's a pretty ok coming of age story but you shouldn't bother with it if you're older than 14

## 2/5
